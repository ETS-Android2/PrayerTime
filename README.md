<h1 align = "center"> App Features </h1>

In the calculation process, the app uses the default values needed to calculate prayer times that includes; the Shafii juristic method, Umm al-Qura, Makkah calculation method, 12-hour time format, and no adjustment methods for Higher Latitudes. However, the user can change these values as needed from the settings page. 

Furthermore, the user can login/register to the app by entering their email and password. As an extra functionality, the user can change their login credentials (email and password). After the prayer time is calculated, the app notifies users when a prayer time enters. 

The app also grants users the ability to switch the phone to silent mode for a specified period of time to avoid ringing if the user is in a mosque.
